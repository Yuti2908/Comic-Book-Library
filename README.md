# Comic-Book-Library
A Comic book library where you can get recommendations based on the books you liked

The project is converted into a zip file as it's a bit large, download it and follow the instructions given below.

This project was made in python 3.9.12 using streamlit. Install the packages mentioned in requirement.txt. Checkout this [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AW33HN0oY0pS3Z5NMm9yGRjJUmRQXn36/view?usp=sharing] video for demo of the Web-App. 
Note: there's a chance that the file might not open directly on drive but download option will show up to check it out.

To run this project make a virtual environment for streamlit and type in command prompt:
(streamlitenv) C:\User\Username\folder_name\>python -m streamlit run Bookstore.py

here "streamlitenv" is the name of virtual environment created for streamlit to run and "folder_name" is the folder in which all the files in the repo is saved.

Datasets in this project were extracted/created using a larger dataset from Goodreads which you can get from: [https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/home] 
Note: these datasets dont need to be downloaded but can be checked out for reference.

The overall Role of this project was to find the recommendations for books based on the books which you like and the users who have similar taste in books, so that you can choose that book to read next. 
It's inspired from Goodreads website.
